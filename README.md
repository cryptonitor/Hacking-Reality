# Hacking-Reality
Reality as recursive emergence and how this makes next levels of reality accesible

Every layer of perceived reality, that is accessible for interaction or observation is built on emergent rules that can be discovered and leveraged.
dDestliling these rules and to evolves emergence within life itself to breach on through to the co-creation of next-layer portions of reality.
In doing this the layering of realities becomes decodable through participatory tools (like quantum mechanics, AI, synthetic biology, mathematics).

Reality as writable: Our role isnt passive (ref quantum observer phenomena). 
Pathways to intervention: ????? life-as-information-trnsference ??? //TODO: apply findings from omniversal deepspace comsys

Background: "The universe" has layered abstractions (rules of physics, entropy, causality, locality etc). Products of these abstracted constraints point towards possibilities of higher-order emergence (like hacking reality and getting to the next layer of reality).

Quantum-like state collapsor: Alignment of observerers (humans with their internals) in perceiving and understanding reality closely linked to opening new layers. Complementary alignment
